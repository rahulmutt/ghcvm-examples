# Prerequisites
- JDK 8
  - JavaFX must be installed in the home directory of the JDK.
    - If you're running Ubuntu OpenJDK, you'll have to do an [extra step](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34243982/why-is-javafx-is-not-included-in-openjdk-8-on-ubuntu-wily-15-10):
      ```sudo apt-get install openjfx```
- [Eta](https://github.com/typelead/eta) (On `master` branch)
